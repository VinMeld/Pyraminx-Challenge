An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

## What I learnt:

Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical of the pyraminx challenge. I had never done anything similar to this before. It took me a while to wrap my head around the concept of the algorithms needed to complete the pyraminxs. I had to stop thinking of the individual pieces and started to think of it as a whole and the relation of effecting one. Eventually, with the help of _Mohammed_, I was able to solve the pyraminx and develop a better understanding of algorithms. It also aided me in comprehending multi dimensional arrays, also known as matrices. It helped me understand how to picture matrices and how to manipulate them and change even them. The pyraminx also helped me understand the concept of 3D shapes and space and how to manipulate them and change them. The pyraminx is full of patterns, solving it helped me as now I can spot patterns more easily in everyday life or while programming.

An algorithm to me, is a set of mouvements or instructions in order to meet desired requirements. Different algorithms will take a different amount of time to complete, or will require more instructions to get to the end goal. This is true for the pyraminx challenge, as the pyraminx, is relatively easy to complete compared to the 3x3 etc. In computer science, this knowledge of algorithms can be applied to creating programs. In order to complete a program, an algorithm must be made, it can be complex, or simple.  

A  matrices is a rectangular array of quantities or expressions in rows and columns that is treated as a single entity and manipulated according to particular rules. 

To me, a matrices is almost like a grid system, and except one that you can change with ease. This challenge helped me understand it, as each face is sort of like a matrice, where each block is a position or point in the matrix. 

In computer science, there are times where being able to code in 3D space and understand it is important. This, helped me have a better understanding on how to manipulate 3D space and change it.
