An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

## What I learnt:

Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical of the pyraminx challenge. I had never done anything similar to this before. It took me a while to wrap my head around the concept of the algorithms needed to complete the pyraminxs. I had to stop thinking of the individual pieces and started to think of it as a whole and the relation of effecting one. Eventually, with the help of _Mohammed_, I was able to solve the pyraminx and develop a better understanding of algorithms. It also aided me in comprehending multi dimensional arrays, also known as matrices. It helped me understand how to picture matrices and how to manipulate them and change even them. The pyraminx also helped me understand the concept of 3D shapes and space and how to manipulate them and change them. 

An algorithm to me, is a set of mouvements or instructions in order to meet desired requirements. Different algorithms will take a different amount of time to complete, or will require more instructions to get to the end goal. This is true for the pryaminx challenge, as the pryaminx, is relatively easy to complete compared to the 3x3 etc. In computer science, this knowledge of alogrithms can be applied to creating programs. In order to complete a program, an algorithm must be made, it can be complex, or simple.  

A  matrices is a rectangular array of quantities or expressions in rows and columns that is treated as a single entity and manipulated according to particular rules. 

To me, a matrice is almost like a grid system, and, execpt one that you can change with ease. This challenge helped me understand it, by each face is sort of like a matrice, each with
