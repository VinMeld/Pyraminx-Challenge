## What I learnt:

Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical of the pyraminx challenge. I had never done anything similar to this before. It took me a while to wrap my head around the concept of the algorithms needed to complete the pyraminxs. I had to stop thinking of the individual pieces and started to think of it as a whole and the relation of effecting one. Eventually, with the help of _Mohammed_, I was able to solve the pyraminx and develop a better understanding of algorithms. It also aided me in comprehending multi dimensional arrays, also known as matrices. It helped me understand how to picture matrices and how to manipulate them and change even them. The pyraminx also helped me understand the concept of 3D shapes and space and how to manipulate them and change them.
